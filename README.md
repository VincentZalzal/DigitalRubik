# DigitalRubik
Software for a digital rubik cube made of LEDs and a microcontroller.

- RGB LEDs are used for the facelets.
- Metal rings on the facelets allow detecting the current flowing through the player's body, acting as touch controls.
- An Atmel 8-bit microcontroller, programmed in C++, is handling all the game's logic, the LED control, the touch inputs and the various game animations.
- An OpenGL simulator has been developed to prototype animations and control.
